                    </div>

                    <p class="text">
                        One of the most effective meditation strategies for beginners is to
                        discover a steady mental focal point to concentrate on.
                        <br>
                        For this technique, you need to find a quiet spot free of distractions
                        and set aside some time. Five minutes will be enough for a start, and
                        be sure to choose a soft melodic alarm tone so it doesn’t startle you
                        at the end! Sit in a comfortable yet alert position, and keep silently
                        repeating three or four appreciative positive phrases.
                        Try “I am worthy,” ”I am proud of myself,” or ”I can do
                        this.” Feel free to create your own affirmations! Be sure to breathe
                        through the diaphragm (learn how to do it properly here) and feel your
                        mind clearing and confidence enhancing.

                    <p class="text">
                        Physical activity decreases cortisol and increases endorphins, 
                        helping you feel happier and healthier. You don’t even have to go
                         anywhere to get that boost! You totally can work out at home and practice
                          anything you like, from pilates to kickboxing. “Moving meditation” through
                           exercise is an amazing way to decrease stress.<br><br>

                      When you’re under a lot of pressure, your body automatically reacts to it
                       and can become strained and stiff. Help it relax and boost your mood by 
                       moving just a bit! You can add visualization to your daily workout to let 
                       go of troubles and worries. Imagine that you exhale stress, and it vanishes
                        into thin air (literally).

                    <p class="text">
                        With our crazy schedules, we often try to do many things simultaneously
                        while eating, like scrolling through our phones or answering work emails.
                        Cooking and enjoying comfort food, on the other hand, may cheer
                        up both you and your loved ones if you do it together, and mindfully, too!<br><br>

                        Practice becoming more mindful about your food to build resilience to
                        stress. Try to establish a healthy diet. Be present, chew slowly, pay
                        attention to each small bite, and savor the taste. Mindful eating helps

                        you be more in tune with your delicious meal, so you’ll enjoy it, and
                        your time around the table with loved ones, much more.

                    </div>

                    <p class="text">
                        Mindful meditation sounds simple: it’s a combination of breathing practices that
                        cultivate awareness of body and mind. But it can be easier said than done!
                        Sitting and trying to focus on the sensations in your body may be 
                        surprisingly challenging. At first, you might notice a flood of random
                        thoughts about nothing in particular. That’s okay – your brain produces 
                        thoughts even while you sleep. The key is to allow your ideas to come and go. 
                        Then, try to gently redirect your focus to the present moment. Guided <br><br>
                        meditation audio with calm music is a must if you’re only just beginning. 
                        But don’t beat yourself up if you feel like you can’t focus right away.
                        Incorporate daily meditation in your self-care routine, do it regularly,
                        and you’ll undoubtedly notice positive changes.
